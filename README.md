2- Credit Risk Models: user profile, EL evaluation for Credit Risk 

based on Internal Ratings-based (IRB) approach to estimate the credit risk: 

Expected Loss = EAD x LGD x PD 

where PD is the probability of default, LGD is the expected loss given default taking a value between 0 and 1, and EAD is the exposure at default. 

The most important and challenging part of estimating credit risk is to model the probability of default.
